# Chess Move Calculator

## Running Tests
I created for my local use a .bat file containing the command to run all tests
that were relevant for the project. However if using a non-windows machine the
.bat file will not be operatable, instead use the following command:

python -m unittest -v boardInitializer_test.py chessboard_test pieceFactory_test.py piecesKnight_test.py piecesKnight_test.py piecesKing_test.py piecesPawn_test.py piecesBishop_test.py piecesRook_test.py piecesQueen_test.py
