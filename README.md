# Chess Move Calculator
The goal of this project was to create a python library that was able to
calculate the number of moves that each player had. There is a section of
Chess Game Theory that discusses "positional play" on a board. It is theorized 
that the player with more moves available to him or her has an advantage in the
game. I figured by starting this project I might later be able to use this
calculation as variable to a machine learning algorithm in a later class. 

## Design
The main three modules that make the calculation go are chessboard.py, pieces.py,
and pieceFactory.py. The class ChessBoard in chessboard.py is a container for the 
rank and files of the board. Pieces are added to the board by using the makePiece
method in pieceFactory. I used complete words as input in the factory because early
on I didn't know how I would be loading up complete boards. It was later in the
project's development I decided on .fen files (explained in a later section).
Finally pieces.py contains a Piece base class that handles core piece logic such as
determining if a move would be illegal, getting squares, and determining out of bounds.

## Running Tests
I created for my local use a .bat file containing the command to run all tests
that were relevant for the project. However if using a non-windows machine the
.bat file will not be operatable, instead use the following command:

python -m unittest -v boardInitializer_test.py chessboard_test pieceFactory_test.py piecesKnight_test.py piecesKnight_test.py piecesKing_test.py piecesPawn_test.py piecesBishop_test.py piecesRook_test.py piecesQueen_test.py


## Board files
As testing moved from singular piece classes to entire board states, I found myself
in need of a way to save and load board files. I ended up deciding on 
[Forsyth-Edwards Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation)
files (.fen) to allow for a representation that was easily to read and quickly created.
During research I found there were representation that allowed for better compression,
but these were often harded to read with the human eye. I ended up using the
[following website](http://www.netreal.de/Forsyth-Edwards-Notation/index.php?) to quickly
generate files to integration test with.

### Reading .fen files
Forsyth-Edwards notation works as follows: 

Pieces are represented as letters...
+ K for King
+ Q for Queen
+ R for Rook
+ B for Bishop
+ N for Knight
+ P for Pawn

Upper case letters denote white pieces and lower case denote black pieces. \\ characters
denote the different ranks. Numbers denote blank spaces, where "2" would be 2 squares without
any peices in them.
